# CS-template

Empty repository with MS C# .gitignore (updated 6/21/2023)

## Changes

*.mdf files are normally ignored. I have commented this feature out so that the .mdf file will be part of your project repository. This will allow me to run your program without me having to add a database file to the project.

After the first commit, uncheck this file in the changes list in GitHub Desktop to prevent subsequent updates after the first commit.
